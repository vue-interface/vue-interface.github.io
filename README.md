# Vue Interface

This is a monorepo for the components of [Vue Interface](https://github.com/vue-interface). Components are organized in packages. The purpose of this monorepo is to provide a convenient and efficient way to develop and maintain UI components that are dependent on each other without relying on symlinks and other hacks that provide less than optimal development experiences. The goal is provide a collection of CLI tools so you can develop, version and publish for individual packages all from the root of the repo. The monorepo also utilizes [VitePress](https://vuejs.github.io/vitepress/v1/) for clean documentation.

**[📚 Read the Documentation](https://vue-interface.github.io/)**

## Installation

We prefer `pnpm`, but you can use `npm` or `yarn` to install too. 

```bash
pnpm i vue-interface
```

## Developing

To start developing in the monorepo run the following commands. `pnpm install` should be ran the first time, after any package.json updates or when adding another package.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## VitePress Documentation
This monorepo utilizes [VitePress](https://vuejs.github.io/vitepress/v1/) for detailed documentation. To open, ensure you are in the root directory, then run:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```
This will open VitePress on `localhost:5173`.

## Versioning

Each package is independently versioned using strict [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The monorepo uses [Changesets](https://akinoccc.github.io/changesets/) to manage versions and changelogs for all packages independently. When a package introduces a change, only that package receives a version bump and other packages remain unaffected.

### Creating a Changeset
After making changes to one or more packages, create a changeset to document what changed:

::: code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm changeset
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn changeset
```
:::

This interactive command will:

1. Ask which packages changed - Select the packages you modified (use spacebar to select, enter to confirm)
2. Ask for version bump type - Choose the semantic version bump for each package:
    - major - Breaking changes (e.g., removing a prop, changing API)
    - minor - New features (e.g., adding a new prop, new functionality)
    - patch - Bug fixes (e.g., fixing a rendering issue)
3. Ask for a summary - Write a brief description of the change (this appears in the changelog)

### Example CLI Workflow

```bash
🦋 Which packages would you like to include?
  ◉ @vue-interface/input-field ← Select this package (press space)
  ◯ @vue-interface/btn
  ◯ @vue-interface/form-control
 
🦋 What kind of change is this for @vue-interface/input-field?
  major (breaking change)
  minor (new feature)
  ❯ patch (bug fix) ← Select this option (press space)

🦋 Please enter a summary:
  Fix styling error when input is disabled
```

The Changesets CLI then generates a markdown file in the .changeset/ directory with a random name (e.g., cool-lions-dance.md).
